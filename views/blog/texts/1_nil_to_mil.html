CareforAll concluded its 1000+ camp this June and we couldn’t be happier. Over a year of dedication and collaboration with various stakeholders - enthusiastic volunteers, caring doctors and passionate NGOs - has enabled us to impact over 1000 lives in far-reaching and meaningful ways.

On 7th June, 2024 we worked with doctors of Sparsh Hospital, and the Samridhdhi Trust Bridge Project to deliver health-check ups to migrant children through a medical camp. The childrens’ vitals were checked and noted down by our volunteers, following which the children handed over a sheet filled with their unique data to doctors on site for further assessment and advice. This way, CareforAll’s medical camps pay attention to the individual needs of those it strives to help. 

When asked why he decided to volunteer for our 1000+ camp, one of our doctors stated, “I was curious to see what’s actually out there in the peripheries, it’s truly a fresh, unique experience.” Along similar lines, that is what CareforAll has long strived to do - acknowledge those who are often neglected in a world where it seems that health is confined to the realm of sterilized hospitals and doctor’s prescriptions. Our doctors used the data of the children’s vitals to advise them accordingly. For example, those underweight were encouraged to improve their nutrition - perhaps by eating more, or taking the multi nutrition syrups which were prescribed to them. Practicing dental hygiene was also encouraged. Indeed, health begins in the household. Simple practices can make a huge difference. 

The milestone is a special one - one that could be attributed to the upbeat atmosphere of the day. The camp, which ran for 4 hours, went smoothly and culminated in the formation of new relationships, friendly conversations and learnings for many of us. The equipment used was all contributed by the volunteers and ourselves, making the endeavour a cost-free one, and proving that health can be monitored by devices that are widely accessible and often found at home. It does make one wonder - doesn’t it seem pretty easy to take responsibility for our wellbeing?

The children gathered near the tent and came in groups to check their weight, height, oxygen levels, pulse rate and temperature with the help of our volunteers. Delegation of work makes the entire process at our camps so much smoother, and leaves us time to sincerely interact with the kids. Accordingly, our camps create a comfortable space for all stakeholders to enjoy. While the volunteers were busy with oximeters and weighing scales, Arnav stayed busy engaging the doctors and entertaining the kids - at one point even getting attacked by a mountain of hugs. 

We can say with confidence that a CareforAll medical camp has much benefit to whoever participates, whether it is through exchanges about cricket and Virat Kohli or gaining skills about taking vitals, communication and empathy. Not only was the camp memorable for its demarcation of our 1000+ impact, but the sunny weather, smiles and dancing by a talented performer (check out our reel to see!) made it truly unforgettable. We wish we could say that the dance-off between Arnav and the breakdancing boy was a close one, but the odds really were stacked against one of them.

We began with a goal to spread health literacy amongst our local community, and to provide those in need with a means to access their right to health. We are extremely grateful that we have made big strides towards making this happen, including getting published in the national newspaper Times of India and now, having helped over 1000 people. Of course, we couldn’t have done it without your help. CareforAll would like to thank you for all your support, and we hope to see more in the future!
