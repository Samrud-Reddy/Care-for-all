“May I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help” - Hippocratic Oath

In the constantly evolving landscape of healthcare, every hand counts when fighting potentially
life-threatening diseases. Yet, even among these courageous souls, there stands a cadre of
dedicated professionals who stand at the cornerstone of medical advancement and true care for
ailing patients. These individuals all come from diverse and culturally different backgrounds
span a range of specialties and disciplines and yet stand united in pioneering the future of
medicine. From the frontlines of emergency rooms in war-torn and developing areas to the
innately contemplative spaces of research labs, these prominent healthcare workers leave an
indelible impact on the lives they touch and the communities they dedicate themselves to serve.
At CareForAll we follow in their large footsteps in innovation, compassion and the relentless
pursuit of efficient access to healthcare. We believe that by acknowledging significant leaps that
have been made by other visionaries, we can learn from them and contribute to their noble
mission. This blog post delves into the lives and contributions of these remarkable individuals,
highlighting their incredible journeys and the significant impacts they have made on the world
of healthcare.

At the forefront of healthcare and human rights stands Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Dr Dennis
Mukwege, a beacon of hope in the dark and stigmatised atmosphere of sexual violence in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and beyond. Mukwege grew up in Bukavu, the son of a
Pentecostal minister, and he first became aware of the healthcare situation around him when
visiting ailing parishioners with his father. After reading medicine in Burundi, he chose to
return home and focus on gynaecology after witnessing the harsh circumstances that rural
women faced when giving birth. In 1989, he established his first obstetrics service in Lemera,
yet it was destroyed in the 1996 civil war. The culmination of his years of experience was the
Panzi Hospital, where he served as Director. Although the initial goal of the hospital was to
provide maternal care, eventually it started to receive victims of sexual violence, some as young
as three years old. Dr. Mukwege took it upon himself to provide not only physical attention but
psychological and legal assistance. He explains “We can’t just treat the finger or the ear, we have
to see the person as an entire whole”. This philosophy stands as a paragon for the way we must
treat these victims, not only providing medical support but helping them recover from the
deplorable crimes that are faced daily by people from rural or lower socio-economic classes, the
kind of people that go unnoticed by modern healthcare giants and the kind of people we at
CareForAll aim to facilitate, aspiring to amplify the reach of such visionaries who serve as an
inspiration to for their resilience and unwavering commitment to a world where all people have
access to quality healthcare.

Fighting for healthcare does not only have to be on the frontlines, rather it can be executed by
those people who use their knowledge to advocate for those whose voices are ignored.
Exemplifying this philosophy is Dr. James P. Grant, who was the executive director of UNICEF
from 1980 to 1995, who contributed greatly to child survival by emphasising the importance of
comparatively basic interventions such as immunizations, oral rehydration therapy and
breastfeeding promotion. His bold initiatives, including the Child Survival and Development
Revolution, catalysed unprecedented reductions in child mortality. By using his power to
champion community-based healthcare strategies that focused on people helping each other out
and partnering with NGOs, Grant transformed UNICEF into a powerhouse for child health
advocacy. His legacy serves to inspire us even to date, and the tenets of his devotion to
healthcare serve as an inspiration to us at CareForAll to fight even harder and cooperate
towards the communal goal of openly accessible healthcare and awareness. Grant’s enduring
impact also serves as a reminder of the transformative power of visionary leadership and
collective actions in improving the lives of the most vulnerable members of society.

These two men only represent a mere fraction of the number of people who put their own lives
on the line every day to keep everybody safe regardless of socioeconomic class or race. With
such big shoes to fill, CareForAll is dedicated to working harder each day towards having an
impact on people’s lives, however, we can’t do it alone. No matter how small, take the step
towards being one of the people that changed the world. And it begins with you.
